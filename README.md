# ![Ready Up](https://readyup2.herokuapp.com/)  

:warning: ðŸš§ **Project Still In Development**
This game library application is currently in development.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, SASS, JavaScript, React, Node, Express, and MongoDB

Built using React as the front-end framework. Main functionality is integration with the RAWG API and storing user libraries to MongoDB. Styling is a custom-made SASS library. Node and Express are used for server-side authentication.

## Explanation:

This is a web application where you can create a user account, browse for games that you own, and add them to a virtual library. You can then view all owned games in your library and view some information about those games.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:
